## General

<p style="font-size: 23px">How can my child participate?</p>

        <p style="font-size: 23px">I am an adult, can I participate or are your studies just for kids? </p>

        <p style="font-size: 23px">I’m involved in an organization for children (e.g., school, childcare), can we participate?</p>

        <p style="font-size: 23px">I got a letter about a study through my child’s school, what will that involve?</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">One way we like to run our studies is through their school. If you agree to have your child participate and fill out the consent documentation, we will briefly pull them from class and play some proportional reasoning games.</p>
