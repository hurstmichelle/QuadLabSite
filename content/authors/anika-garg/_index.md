I am interested in understanding how kids develop concepts of language based on the multilinguistic, cultural and intellectual cues. In the Quad lab, I aim to translate these learnings into understanding how similar or different the development of mathematical thinking is, and whether the language of instruction plays a part in it. The motivation is to be able to explore outcomes that can be applied in school settings, particularly for early intervention programs.
