I'm interested in how environmental factors shape language development and how this process interacts with higher-order cognition (e.g. decision-making). In the Quad Lab, I aim to deepen these understandings through combining behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and potentially neuroimaging methods. The goal is to provide educators with evidence-based insights into how language and cognition co-develop, and together foster a more scientific and equitable learning environment for children.
