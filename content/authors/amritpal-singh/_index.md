I am interested in abstract cognition. What are the contextual and developmental forces that shape how abstractly we think and the manner in which we reason about abstract entities? In my dissertation work, I investigated differences in abstract thought across and within cultures, operationalizing abstract thought in different ways (i.e., event cognition and analogical reasoning). In the Quad Lab, I am interested in studying how context and time can shape how we think and learn about abstractions like quantity, probability, and proportion.
